# Transfermarkt Simple Daily Quiz

A web application that tests your football knowledge by challenging you to identify players based on their transfer history. This project is a simple implementation of a daily football quiz game.

## About the Project

This is a simple daily quiz application where:
- Each quiz shows a player's transfer history
- You need to guess the player's name
- You can use hints (with point penalty)
- Scores are tracked for each daily challenge

**Note:** This is an early version of the application. The project is still in development and new features are planned.
